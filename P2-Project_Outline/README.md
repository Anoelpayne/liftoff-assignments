## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application is for people who suffer from an illness or a trajedy and need a little extra support and love at this time in their lives. It will act like a portal where loved ones can stay informed and offer support. Whether that be donate money, make a meal, or just post a positive message. The users who are asking for support will be able to create updates and photos to share with loved ones as well as ask for favors and donations. The users who are friends and family of the affected will be able to stay informed and offer aid through the app. My older sister, who is only 36 years old, was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. While she is thrilled with the outreach of support and well wishes from friends and family, she finds it is challenging to keep everyone informed and in the loop. This app is for my sister.
